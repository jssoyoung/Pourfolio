# Pourfolio

## Description

This MERN stack single-page application was created for wine lovers. The user could use this application to keep track of their favorite wines! The user will need to create a log-in. After the user creates a log-in, the user could use the search bar to look up a name of a wine. The user could give that wine a rating from 1-5. The user could also add the wine to their list to indicate which wines they already tried. The user could also update or even delete their account. This application contains notes on both the client and server side. Google custom search API was used within this application.
